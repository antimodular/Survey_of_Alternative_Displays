# 2022 Update Notes

(Original version from [Blair Neal](https://www.ablairneal.com))

This article was originally [created and hosted on Medium](https://laserpilot.medium.com/survey-of-alternative-displays-82d928480b9d), but its length on a single page made it very unweildy to keep it updated with fresh content. Additionally, most of the information is from the original writeup from 2015 and needs a pretty serious update as many things have changed in 7 years.&#x20;

This update will be ongoing and some sections may be more updated than others. Gitbook may not be the final resting place but it seems like the best approach for now.

ðŸŒŸIf you're on Github: This page is auto generated by Gitbook and is more readable [at the link here](https://blair-neal.gitbook.io/survey-of-alternative-displays/), especially for things like embedded videos.

If you're on Gitbook, the link to the [Github for this article is here](https://github.com/laserpilot/Survey\_of\_Alternative\_Displays). Please contribute if you'd like!

If your project or image is featured here and you would prefer me to remove it, please send me a message/email/etc (contact info on [my website](https://www.ablairneal.com)). Additionally, if you have something you think needs to change or be added, please submit a pull request and I'll add it in.

**Additions for 2022 compared to the original 2015 version:**

This is currently using Gitbook's free plan. If there is enough interest, I could set up a tipjar or something for this project and open it up as a paid project with multiple contributors and the ability to export the entire thing as a formatted PDF.
