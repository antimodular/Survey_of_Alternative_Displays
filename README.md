# 2022 Update Notes

This article was originally [created and hosted on Medium](https://laserpilot.medium.com/survey-of-alternative-displays-82d928480b9d), but its length on a single page made it very unweildy to keep it updated. Additionally, most of the information is from the original writeup from 2015 and needs a pretty serious update as many things have changed in 7 years.&#x20;

This update will be ongoing and some sections may be more updated tha ohers. Gitbook may not be the final resting place but it seems like the best approach

ðŸŒŸIf you're on Github: This page is auto generated by Gitbook and is more readable [at the link here](https://blair-neal.gitbook.io/survey-of-alternative-displays/), especially for things like embedded videos.

If you're on Gitbook, the link to the [Github for this article is here](https://github.com/laserpilot/Survey\_of\_Alternative\_Displays). Please contribute if you'd like!

This is currently using Gitbook's free plan. If there is enough interest, I could set up a tipjar for this project and open it up as a paid project with multiple contributors and the ability to export the entire thing as a formatted PDF.
