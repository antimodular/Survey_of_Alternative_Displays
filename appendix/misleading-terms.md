# Misleading Terms

This section will cover some brief notes on frequently misleading terms used to market various displays. Here are a few:

* [Hologram](misleading-terms.md#holograms)
* [Autostereoscopic Displays/3D TV's](misleading-terms.md#autostereoscopic-displays-3d-tvs)
* [LED TV’s](misleading-terms.md#led-tvs)

### Holograms

It should be mentioned that none of the displays mentioned in other sections are in line with the definition of a [hologram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography). A hologram is closer to a photographic medium as it captures an imprint of the light waves that bounce off an object. Most of the media headlines these days with the word “hologram” are typically talking about simple optical tricks or AR. Holograms have taken on a cultural meaning that differs from the scientific definition, similar to the cultural rebranding of “synesthesia” or “literally.” This [article](http://doc-ok.org/?p=1172) by Oliver Reylos has a concise summary of what is considered holographic and what isn’t. In his words:

_When viewing close-by objects, there are six major depth cues that help us perceive three dimensions:_

* _Perspective foreshortening: farther away objects appear smaller_
* _Occlusion: nearer objects hide farther objects_
* _Binocular parallax / stereopsis: left and right eyes see different views of the same objects_
* _Monocular (motion) parallax: objects shift depending on how far away they are when head is moved_
* _Convergence: eyes cross when focusing on close objects_
* _Accommodation: eyes’ lenses change focus depending on objects’ distances_

Almost all of the displays or techniques in this article have some holographic properties like parallax or multiple viewing angles, but are primarily in a class of their own. Would you call an oil painting a sculpture?

### Autostereoscopic Displays/3D TV's

3D TV's are primarily a marketing term for something that is more accurately called an autostereoscopic display. These TV's aren't pushed as much in 2022 because they never really caught on for most of the public, primarily because they overpromised the 3D effect.

### LED TV's

This term has been mixed up for a while and is more accurately known as an LED-Backlit TV.&#x20;

LED's as a light source were an important development for backlit LCD's many years ago and allowed the creation of thinner and more energy efficient LCD displays of the traditional CCFL (Cold Cathode Flourescent Light) light source. Unfortunately  the marketing term causes them to be mixed up with [LED video displays](../standard-displays/led.md) which use a very different approach for creating light. There are more and more displays and TV's that are starting to use things like [microLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroLED) technology that will eventually make this even more confusing, but for now you can usually assume that an LED TV or monitor is usually only referring to the backlight.
