# Switchable Glass

Using switchable smartglass for creating low fidelity static displays

There are a couple different approaches here:

* PDLC
* Electrochromic
* SPD
* LCD

### PDLC

PDLC is Polymer-dispersed liquid crystal. When an electrical current is applied, it basically goes from clear to diffuse and opaque. The reaction and change occurs very quickly and can be used to create unusual effects. It also uses a low amount of energy compared to traditional displays. When electrical current is not applied, the film is opaque, but when it is applied it becomes transparent. This effect is also "dimmable" in the sense that varying levels of current can ramp the opacity up or down.

Artist Simon Heijdens has one of the better known examples of using PDLC in  in their project [Shade](http://www.simonheijdens.com/indexbig.php?type=project\&name=Shade) that uses hundreds of triangles and nearly invislble electrical leads to create different visual effects with sunlight.

### SPD

Suspended Particle Device

Similar to PDLC in mechanism, but more of an opacity change than diffusion. It primarily stays in one color that is sort of a purple blue.

### Electrochromic

(WIP)

### LCD

LCD is a bit of a different class here and has been discussed briefly in the [transparent ](../displays/transparent.md)section, but it uses large LCD panels as individual pixels to turn different grayscale colors. It has been used for projects such as Sosolimited and Hypersonic's [Patterned by Nature](https://www.hypersonic.cc/art#/patterned-by-nature/)&#x20;

Jason Bruge's studio also makes heavy use of specialized LCD panels, like in the piece [Digital Fountain](https://www.jasonbruges.com/digital-fountain/).

Finding a source for making custom LCD's in this way is a bit of a challenge since they are such a niche product. One source may be [Pacer](https://www.pacer-usa.com/displays/mono-lcd-displays/custom-lcd-lcm/). Another is [White Wing Logic](http://whitewing.co.uk) based in the UK who has created or advised on a number of the projects for Jason Bruge's studio.
