# Cathode Ray Tube

(Work in progress)

### CRT

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray\_tube) for CRT

I don't think I could explain CRT stuff much better than the wikipedia page, so you're better off looking there, but here are some videos worth watching.&#x20;

The notable stuff for using CRT's in new installations is that they are finicky, not super bright (don't use them outside), and can sometimes have issues with filming well.

There are still providers out there for buying [CRT's for things like museum installations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/a-guy-in-minnesota-is-the-museum-worlds-answer-to-old-technology/2018/04/19/78cae5aa-3dcd-11e8-8d53-eba0ed2371cc\_story.html). See [Dotronix](https://dotronix.com) for more info on buying "new" CRT's.&#x20;

### Vectex Displays

These are essentially a different flavor of a CRT display, but they should be mentioned in the same breath. See some videos featuring these below:
