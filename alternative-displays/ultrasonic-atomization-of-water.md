# Ultrasonic Atomization Of Water

## Ultrasonic Atomizers <a href="#b816" id="b816"></a>

An ultrasonic atomizer is a device that converts a normal stream of liquid into a very fine mist. It consists of a generator and a probe. The generator creates vibrations and focuses them at the tip of the probe. As the liquid flows through the probe, it is converted into fine particles.

The ultrasonic atomizer has a power supply that converts low-frequency electrical energy to high-frequency electrical energy. This electrical energy is then converted into mechanical vibrations by a piezoelectric transducer, which is typically made of ceramic. The vibration is sent back to the piezoelectric transducer after it has bounced off the tip of the probe. This increases the strength of the vibration and creates a pumping action that draws liquid toward the center of the probe.

Artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer has used this techquie for multiple artworks. By creating large arrays of ultra sonic atomizeters horizontal as well as vertical displays where created.
