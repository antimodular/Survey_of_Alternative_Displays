### Wedge Display

The [CamFPD Wedge Display ](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/news/flat-screen-tv-masses-innovative-wedge-screen-offers-bigger-cheaper-displays)- No updates or news since 2004. Seems to be a similar principle to waveguide displays used for AR headsets by "projecting" light on a flat plane.

### Lickable Display

A [researcher](https://www.reuters.com/technology/lick-it-up-japan-professor-creates-tele-taste-tv-screen-2021-12-23/) has combined a traditional display with an aerosol dispenser to spray a screen with different flavors that can be licked by a user to be able to taste what is on screen. The project is called Taste the TV by researcher Homei Miyashita

### Liquavista Electrowetting Displays

These displays promised an alternative to E-Ink but with a faster refresh rate but never made it to market. [You can read more about them here](https://lookgadgets.com/liquavista/).
