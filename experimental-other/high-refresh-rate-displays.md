# High Refresh Rate Displays

(Work in progress)

This page is a placeholder for some sources on high refresh rate displays and their applications. There is a lot of creative potential in a high refresh rate display that is still largely untapped. Most manufacturers are pursuing effects in the spatial/resolution dimension, but as monitors get 240hz and beyond, there are new untapped areas of visual exploration and information delivery that can be explored.

Most of the conversation around high refresh rates is dominated by gaming displays and applications to gaming, so it can be hard to find interesting updates that are outside of that space.

Some refresh rate comparisons on a 390hz display:
