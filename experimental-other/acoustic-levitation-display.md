# Acoustic Levitation Display

(Work in progress)

Also referred to as an Acoustophoretic Volumetric Display

This area of research uses ultrasonic soundwaves to "levitate" thin and light particles of material and move them at a high enough speed to make coherent images.

There are a number of labs and researchers exploring this technique There is a DIY approach called a [Sonic Surface](https://www.instructables.com/SonicSurface-Phased-array-for-Levitation-Mid-air-T/).

There is [JOLED](https://archive.sussex.ac.uk/news/press-releases/id/37420?id=37420) from the University of Sussex
