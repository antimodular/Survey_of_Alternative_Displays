# Physical/Mechanical Displays

Some artists also work with display surfaces that don’t emit light or use optics at all. Most of these displays are entirely custom and work with a massive array of motors or other electromechanical means. Haptic communication is another big one that is being explored with this type of “display.” The line between sculpture and information display is really blurred with these, so its tough to quantify exactly what falls into a display and what is just a lot of motorized elements.

There are some commercially available physical displays such as [Flipdot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-disc\_display) displays. There are just a [few](http://www.scoretronics.com/components/) [vendors](http://www.flipdots.com) for these in the world. These work by using electromagnets to flip a metal disk that has different colors on each side. They are capable of fairly simple graphics since they are essentially just binary pixels. There have been a few [installations](http://breakfastny.com/dot-screen) that have figured out how to make them switch fast enough to do full video representations. There is also an audio component to having so many elements mechanically flipping at once, as in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJU2-1X8kHQ) of a large 588x216 resolution screen. There is also the potential to develop them to have the discs spin completely 360, which when combined with a variable speed, they would be able to represent grayscale values instead of just on-off.

There are a ton of other variations on this same concept that either use an array of motors or electromagnets. The artist Daniel Rozin has been exploring this concept for years with a ton of different materials — trash, wood, [penguin dolls](http://www.bitforms.com/rozin/penguins-mirror), [metal balls](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/newshinyballsmirror.html) — etc. There are also pieces that take this concept into a third dimension and use elements [suspended on wires](http://www.hypersonic.cc/%23!/projects/breakingwave) to represent limited forms in 3D. The same concept has been applied to a [fleet of drones](http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/intel-beautifully-lit-sky-first-faa-approved-drone-swarm-171318) that were used to render low resolution volumes.

These physical displays continue to get more sophisticated as the years go on. This [display](http://breakfastny.com/thread-screen) was created out of special spools of thread that had a gradient of colors on them. By knowing the motor’s position, the software was able to know which color was currently on the front of the display, allowing them to render pixelated portraits of user generated photos. [This one](https://vimeo.com/99030884) called the Megafaces Pavilion was made of thousands of actuated LED elements that were used to render people’s faces for the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

As mentioned, these kinds of physical actuated displays are also used in conjunction with projection to add haptics as another layer of interaction and collaboration. The [inFORM](http://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/inform/) from MIT has been the classic example of this for the last couple years. Some [researchers](http://www.olivierbau.com/teslatouch.php) are even working on ways to use electrical signals to simulate textures on touch screens — but a full writeup on the future of haptics and displays is one for another article :)
