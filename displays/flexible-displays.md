[Flexible displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible\_display) have been appearing in tech news for years, but very few have reached consumers due to their niche uses and currently high cost of production. In the original version of this writeup in 2016, flexible screens were around in some form, but they were mostly concept units displayed at events liked CES. In 2022, flexible screens are still a niche area and come at a price premium, but they are much more accessible for consumers than they were.

OLED is the technology of choice for fleible displays because it can be manufactured on very thin layers on a plastic substrate. OLEDâ€™s also emit their own light, so there is no need for an additional backlight, allowing for the thinnest possible display. The screens can be bent or rolled a considerable amount, and only one full edge needs to be connected to the electronics that drive the display. There is also a greater potential for these displays to be manufactured in unusual shapes other than rectangles.

While making flexible LCDâ€™s isnâ€™t impossible, there is a limit to the amount of bend that can be achieved and the cost implications make them a less than ideal choice.

One of the intriguing uses of a flexible display is that it can potentially be utilized as a [user interface](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11604680/holoflex-flexible-holographic-smartphone) element. The flex of the screen could be sensed by software and used as a gesture in addition to swipe and tap gestures.&#x20;
