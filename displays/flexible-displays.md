[Flexible displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible\_display) have been appearing in tech news for years, but very few have reached consumers due to their niche uses and currently high cost of production. A few smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy Round or Galaxy Note Edge, have these in the form of screens that have a slight wrap around the edges or a curved body. OLED technology is typically used for these flexible displays, although flexible E-ink screens are also being researched. Here is a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL39u5ZEfYDEMqgqR1pTX\_Xh92tL9vutEv\&v=OE3GLUEPoYQ)of a flexible screen.

Making flexible LCD’s isn’t impossible since there are curved TV’s out there, but the cost implications may be huge. OLED, on the other hand, can be manufactured in very thin layers on a plastic substrate. OLED’s also emit their own light, so there is no need for an additional backlight. The screens can be bent or rolled a considerable amount, and only one full edge needs to be connected to the display driving electronics. There is also a greater potential for these to be manufactured in unusual shapes other than rectangles.

Unfortunately, aside from the smartphones that were mentioned and a few curved TV’s, the market demand isn’t incredibly high for these yet. Manufacturing plants will need to adjust to suit their specialized production, so the price is still much higher than LCDs. The market will need to be convinced that a flexible display is a must-have item in order to boost production and lower costs, but the use cases aren’t incredibly compelling yet. One of the intriguing uses of a flexible display is that it can potentially be utilized as a [user interface](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/5/11604680/holoflex-flexible-holographic-smartphone)element. The flex of the screen could be sensed by software and used as a gesture in addition to swipe and tap gestures. We will see more and more about flexible displays in the next few years as the technology continues to advance. [Here is a 2017 video](https://youtu.be/BKBk1MFoLyc) that features several different flexible AMOLEDs including ones that are used in the iPhoneX.
