LCD’s are a transmissive technology (in contrast to Plasma or LED that are emissive technologies). This means that light passes through a medium to get to your eye. The backlight that is used for LCD’s is meant to provide a strong and very even field of light that gets passed through the actual liquid crystal/polarizer element. Essentially, the backlight is a flat light box that you can fade up or down, but it doesn’t have much else to do with creating the image itself.

A liquid crystal element can function perfectly fine on its own, without a proper backlight. This means that an LCD can effectually work as a transparent monitor if you are keeping some sort of light source between the screen and the viewer. Using an LCD this way yields a lot of interesting possibilities.

A common usage is to put an object in a box with a strong, even light behind it, and have at least one side of the box be a transparent screen. This allows you to superimpose sharp graphics that appear to float overtop of the object inside. This can be combined with a standard touch screen for interactive transparencies. Also, since LCD’s do such a good job at blocking light, when they are displaying black they are nearly impossible to see through, providing a unique reveal effect. A bright point light source can be put behind them to use the LCD as a sort of projection mask — resulting in a variation on a normal projector (your projected image will probably be fuzzy without focusing lens elements though).

Some artists and studios have also been able to source custom LCD elements that are closer to the LCD’s that are used in old pocket calculators with only a few elements that can be turned on and off. Pieces that come to mind are [Hypersonic’s Patterned by Nature](http://www.creativeapplications.net/c/patterned-by-nature-transparent-pixels-in-the-north-carolina-museum-of-natural-sciences/) and [Iris by Hybe](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/iris-by-hybe-new-kind-of-monochrome-lcd/).

A challenge with transparent LCD’s is sourcing usable ones. There is the DIY route, which I cover a little bit in the appendix — but the visual results aren’t great. Only a few commercial vendors supply these screens, and because it is a specialty item, they tend to be more expensive than comparable screens with backlights. You may also be limited by certain available sizes — making it difficult to scale these to a large application. Even if the screens were tiled together, at least one edge needs to have the driver board on it, so its not as easy to tile them together like normal LCD walls. The color reproduction with these tends to be a little duller than the vibrant colors you’re used to. Their transparency can be cloudier compared to regular glass since the polarizer and liquid crystal layers are sandwiched in there as well. I’ve found that black, white and gray content is the most striking on transparent LCD’s.

Transparent OLED’s, however, are a different beast. OLED is an emissive technology and therefore does not require a backlight. This means that brightness and color reproduction will be much better compared to transparent LCD. Their brightness still isn’t going to rival a normal display, so don’t expect to use them outdoors or in a brightly lit space. Also, in contrast to a transparent LCD that works equally on both the front and back, for now transparent OLED is only visible on one side since the emissive element is designed to point in one direction.

Transparent OLED’s are still very useful for a lot of creative applications like being applied to a storefront window without blocking the view or applied onto a mirror so that graphics can be superimposed on top of the mirror. You can also position a camera directly behind them when doing magic mirror digital effects. You can stack multiple OLED’s in front of each other for a layered effect, but there is a caveat. There is a significant darkening effect that occurs when looking through the panels, it’s like a few stops of a neutral density filter — so when you stack them, they get darker and darker as you go backwards. There is also a larger display driver that comes off the back about 8 inches down the long side on the models I have seen, so this limits your ability to layer them closely together for a volumetric display.

As of the end of 2017, transparent OLED screens are not currently being manufactured anymore. Samsung is the only company that ever made these 55” panels — so even if you see Planar or other companies selling or offering transparent OLED, they are always using the Samsung panels on the inside but possibly their own drivers. The reason for Samsung’s decision to end-of-life these display panels is not public knowledge, but there is some speculation as to why. The probable reason is that these screens were difficult to manufacture and had a low yield rate of functional units which would make them less profitable to continue making.

Now that Samsung has stopped manufacturing these panels, be extremely wary of anyone offering them for sale since their lifespan and quality could be questionable. There are probably less than 100 currently available globally and there is no telling how pristine they are. Just like standard OLED, there is a big potential for screen burn-in and loss of luminance over their lifetime. Renting is the best suggestion for anyone looking to use them for an installation. Some potential rental sources I’ve come across are [ABComRents](https://www.abcomrents.com) and [Oxygen Eventworks](http://oxygeneventworks.com).
